#The dataset used is a builtin Dataset
```{r}
data("Loblolly")
summary(Loblolly)
```
#To display the descriptive statistics for a selection of quantitative and categorical variables of the dataset

#To change the variable of the dataset
```{r}
height <- Loblolly$height*1.5
summary(Loblolly)
```
#To plot the quantitative variables
```{r}
plot(Loblolly$height,Loblolly$age)
```

#To perform scatterplots for the dataset

```{r}
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(Loblolly) +
 aes(x = height, y = age) +
 geom_area() +
 theme_minimal()
```

```{r}
ggplot(Loblolly) +
  aes(x = Seed, weight = height) +
  geom_bar(fill = "#112446") +
  theme_minimal()
```
